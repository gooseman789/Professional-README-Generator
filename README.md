  # Description
  My motivation for this was to show my knowledge of these new functions and processes around node.
  I built so so I can build REAMDME files easier in the future.  
  This solves the issue of needing to write a new README every time.
  I learned a lot about using ` marks for strings as well as the writeFile/appendFile functions.
  
  # Installation
  I installed this by cloning my starter code from the bootcamp website and built the rest of the funcitonality afterward.
  
  # Usage
  This can help me create README files for all of my future projects.
  
  # Credits
  I worked on this alone aside from the starter code.

  Not applicable for this repo. 

  # Tests
  I tested my program multiple times to get my working application.  I had to work a lot to get my questions working correctly.  There were a lot of different tests strictly involving retriving and inputting the question answers correctly.
